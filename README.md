Summer project attempt to make an online website for the ReUse center.

Picked up from the last group and had to quickly learn a new language and style without much documentation and a messy codebase.

was able to contribute, and pass along to the next group.

The server is no longer online, but you can run "serveSaveMoneySavePlanet.js" to see a glimpse of the site.
